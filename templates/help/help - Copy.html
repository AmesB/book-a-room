  <h1><a name="topOfPage" class="anchorDrop" id="topOfPage"></a>Help!</h1>
  <p>The Book a Room plug-in comes in two parts. </p>
  <p>The <strong>Meeting Room plugin</strong> manages most of the heavy lifting. It manages staff and public meeting room reservations, settings and administrative functions.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Event Calendar plugin</strong> displays several different things. It shows the public event calendar and gives users detailed event information. It also provides registration forms and a public search function. </p>
  <p>The Event Calendar plug-in can be installed in a separate Wordpress installation. This allows you to offer your events on a different subdomain if needed. It can also run side-by-side with the Meeting Room plug-in on the same site. </p>

  <h3><a name="help_001" id="help_001" class="anchorDrop" 
  ></a><span class="lightMe">Main Settings</span> </h3>
  <p>Use the Main Settings menu to configure  the Meeting Room System. There is a key on the page itself that explains each option in detail.</p>
  <p>Things to remember</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most time-related settings rely on the <strong>Base increment in minutes</strong> value. This is the number of minutes in the smallest reservable increment. If you want to reserve rooms in half hour increments then this value would be 30.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Setup</strong> and <strong>Cleanup increments</strong> are the number of increments before (setup) and after (cleanup) each meeting. If you use both, there will be an hour between each meeting. It's best to choose one or the other. </li>
    <li>For the <strong>URL for reservations page</strong>, check your permalink structure at <a href="options-general.php">Settings</a> &gt; <a href="options-permalink.php">Permalinks</a>.<br />
      <br />
      If your permalinks are set to &quot;Default&quot;, then just use the ID of the page that you have created for your Meeting Room Sign up page.<br />
      If you created a page and the end of the page is: <strong>?page_id=23</strong>, then you would just put <strong>23</strong> as your setting.<br />
      <br />
      If your permalinks are set to anything else, look at the link and include everything after your site's domain name. <br />
      For instance, if your page's URL is:<strong> http://lookatmysitename.com<span id="editable-post-name" title="This is the bit you want!">/meeting-rooms</span>/</strong>, then you would enter<strong> &quot;/meeting-rooms</strong>&quot; (sans quotes). Include the first slash, but not any trailing slash. </li>
    <li>The <strong>Days buffer</strong> and <strong>Allowed buffer</strong> will give you a window where public users are allowed to reserve. If you or your staff are logged in to your site, these are ignored so staff can schedule any date.
    <li>The <strong>Default email for reservations</strong> is just the email that appears in the email box on the daily meeting room report (Daily Schedules &gt; Daily Meetings).
    <li>The screen width defaults to Responsive/Wide. This may look a little odd if your theme is thin. You can force it into a thinner width by choosing narrow from the <strong>Screen Width</strong> drop down.
  </ul>
  <h3>Shortcode</h3>
  <p>On the page you would like to show the meeting room signup and form, put the shortcode <strong>[meetingRooms] </strong>on the page.</p>
  <p><a href="#topOfPage">Back to the top.</a></p>
  <h3><a name="help_002" class="anchorDrop" id="help_002"></a><span class="lightMe">Amenities</span> </h3>
  <p>There are two types of Amenities: <strong>reservable</strong> and <strong>non-reservable</strong>. When you create an amenity, you only need to add a name and check or uncheck &quot;<strong>Reservable?</strong>&quot;</p>
  <p>A <strong>reservable</strong> amenity is one that is available to reserve for a room but isn't a permanent fixture. Examples include TVs, DVD players, Whiteboards and projectors.</p>
  <p>A <strong>non-reservable</strong> amenity is something you would like to let your public know is available but that isn't reservable. Examples could include a refrigerator, sink, projector screen or PA system.</p>
  <p>Configuring your amenities first means that you can add them to each room as you create those rooms. If you create amenities last, you will have to edit your rooms to include all the amenities.</p>
  <p><a href="#topOfPage">Back to the top.</a></p>
  <h3><a name="help_003" class="anchorDrop" id="help_003"></a><span class="lightMe">Branches</span> </h3>
  <p>Branches are physical locations that contain rooms (and room containers). Each branch has a name, address, map link and image that will display on the main meeting room page. The option &quot;<strong>Has 'No Location'</strong>&quot; will add another option to each branch that allows staff to schedule events with no dedicated room. This could be for large events that aren't in a specific room or are outside on library grounds. The hours options here will also limit what times the branch and rooms are open for reservations. The times must be formatted in 12 hour time with both hour and minutes (i.e. 10:00, 5:00). Leaving both open and close times blank will mean the branch is closed on that day.</p>
  <p><a href="#topOfPage">Back to the top.</a></p>
  <h3><a name="help_004" class="anchorDrop" id="help_004"></a><span class="lightMe">Rooms</span> </h3>
  <p>Each room is a representation of a physical space in the branch. Rooms are not reservable themselves, but just describe an area. You only need to enter a name and branch for each room.</p>
  <p><a href="#topOfPage">Back to the top.</a></p>
  <h3><a name="help_005" class="anchorDrop" id="help_005"></a><span class="lightMe">Room Containers</span> </h3>
  <p>Room containers are virtual representations of reservable spaces. A room container can contain one or more rooms. A room container containing 2 rooms (like &quot;Room A and B&quot;) is a reservable space that lets the system know that both room A and room B are reserved at a specific time. If you have three separate containers, &quot;Room A&quot;, &quot;Room B&quot; and &quot;Room A &amp; B&quot; which contain one or both of two rooms, then when a person reserves &quot;Room A &amp; B&quot;, the system knows that both rooms are in use at that time and neither Room A, B or a combination of both will be available to reserve.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Max Occupancy </strong>value is the maximum amount of people that a room container can hold.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Public?</strong> option will allow you to make the room container publicly available. Otherwise, a room container is only available to staff for reservations. This is great for organizing and tracking art galleries and display cases, allowing staff to reserve chunks of time for a display without letting the public access or reserve the space.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Hide on daily?</strong> option works with the <strong>Public?</strong> option to hide a container from the daily meeting room list. If you have a room that is reservable to staff that you don't want showing up on the daily events, you would check this.</p>
